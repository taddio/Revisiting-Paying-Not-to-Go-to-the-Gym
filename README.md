Code for analysing 24 hour fitness data

Important Files are 'Forming Subset and Analysis' for main results, as well as some function in 'Creating Variables'

Functions used to create the create the dataset are a bit sporadic in that  - I will try and sort them into a logical order when I make the time

Ask me any questions if you want to find code for generating a particular variable or performing analysis
